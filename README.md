# üéì Student Grade Analysis ‚Äî Data Mining & Predictive Modeling Project  

> **Predicting students‚Äô academic performance** using socio-economic, behavioral, and family-related factors.  
> Built with Python, Scikit-Learn, and SHAP ‚Äî combining statistics, visualization, and interpretable machine learning.

---

## üìò Project Overview  

This project analyzes and predicts student academic performance using a real-world dataset from **Kaggle**.  
The dataset contains **395 students** and **33 features**, covering demographics, parental education, study time, health, alcohol consumption, and internet access.

Our goal was to **identify the key factors** affecting students‚Äô final grades (`G3`), and to **build predictive models** to support educational decision-making.

The project was completed as part of a **Data Analysis / Data Mining course**, and includes both English and Persian documentation, Jupyter notebook, statistical analysis, and PDF reports.

## üß† Objectives  

- Analyze how social, behavioral, and academic factors influence student performance.  
- Apply regression-based machine learning models to predict final grades.  
- Interpret results with statistical testing and SHAP feature importance.  
- Provide actionable recommendations for educational institutions.

## üßÆ Methodology  

### 1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**  
- Loaded CSV dataset (`student_data.csv`) and verified completeness.  
- Inspected distributions, correlations, and outliers.  
- Removed extreme outliers in `failures`, `absences`, and `age` (>20 years).  
- Applied **binning** and **normalization** to smooth noisy distributions.  

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Generated frequency plots, correlation heatmaps, and boxplots for feature comparison.  
- Found meaningful patterns between **study time**, **internet access**, and **final grades**.  
- Visualized effects of parental education, alcohol use, and attendance.

### 3. **Modeling & Evaluation**  
- Split dataset: **65% training / 35% testing**.  
- Tested multiple regression algorithms:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Ridge Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- Compared using metrics **RMSE**, **R¬≤**, and visual prediction scatter plots.  

| Model | RMSE | R¬≤ |
|--------|------|----|
| Linear Regression | 3.41 | 0.22 |
| Ridge Regression | 3.41 | 0.22 |
| Gradient Boosting | 3.34 | 0.25 |
| **Random Forest** | **3.30** | **0.26 ‚Üí 0.85 after tuning** |

### 4. **Feature Importance (SHAP Analysis)**  
- Used SHAP to interpret which features contributed most to predictions.  
- Major influencing variables:
  - `failures` (number of past course failures)  
  - `absences` (attendance)  
  - `internet` (home internet access)  
  - `Medu` (mother‚Äôs education level)  
  - `goout` (social activity with friends)  
  - `studytime` (weekly study effort)  
  - `health` (self-reported health status)

## üìà Key Insights  

| # | Finding | Explanation |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | **Internet access** improves academic outcomes | Students with internet access achieved significantly higher average grades *(p < 0.001)* |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | **Parental education**, especially mother‚Äôs, shows strong correlation | Indicates a supportive home learning environment |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | **Weekend alcohol consumption** negatively impacts grades | Reflects lifestyle habits influencing focus and consistency |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | **Random Forest** performed best | Achieved **R¬≤ = 0.85** with balanced bias/variance and interpretability |

## üß≠ Recommendations  

- **Internet Programs:** Provide in-school or subsidized home internet for students without access.  
- **Parent Education Workshops:** Educate parents (especially mothers) on how their engagement boosts academic success.  
- **Alcohol Awareness Campaigns:** Highlight the negative correlation between alcohol consumption and academic performance.  
- **Early Intervention:** Use predictive models to identify at-risk students for counseling and mentoring.
